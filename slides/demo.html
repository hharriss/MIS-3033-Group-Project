                        <p>React is a javascript library for building user interfaces. The language was developed and backed by Facebook in 2011. It has grown exponentially since and is now the most widely used for building user interfaces. </p>

                        <h2>How React Works</h2>
                        <p> A React project is compiled of multiple components. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and returns HTML via a render function. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components. We only used Class components</p>

                                <li>Props are arguments passed into React components.</li>
                                <li>Render returns a react element. This render function is defined by another component, and the receiving component shares what is passed through the render function.</li>

                        <p>Neither of us had set up an API and this was the perfect opportunity to try it out. Spotify is open source, which allows users to create their own algorithms and applications. In addition, Spotify created a Developer Showcase, allowing users to share their own applications with the entire Spotify community.  </p>

                    <p>
                        A spotify web application that allows the user to view unique information about their playlists.
                        It displays the name of the user, number of playlists, duration of the playlists, and an explicit ratio.
        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The explicit ratio takes the number of explicit songs in the playlist divided by the number of total songs. It also judges you.
                    </p>
